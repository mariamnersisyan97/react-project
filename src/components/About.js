      <h1>Greek Mythos</h1>
      <p>
        Greek mythology, body of stories concerning the gods, heroes, and
        rituals of the ancient Greeks. That the myths contained a considerable
        element of fiction was recognized by the more critical Greeks, such as
        the philosopher Plato in the 5thâ€“4th century BCE. In general, however,
        in the popular piety of the Greeks, the myths were viewed as true
        accounts. Greek mythology has subsequently had extensive influence on
        the arts and literature of Western civilization, which fell heir to much
        of Greek culture. Although people of all countries, eras, and stages of
        civilization have developed myths that explain the existence and
        workings of natural phenomena, recount the deeds of gods or heroes, or
        seek to justify social or political institutions, the myths of the
        Greeks have remained unrivaled in the Western world as sources of
        imaginative and appealing ideas. Poets and artists from ancient times to
        the present have derived inspiration from Greek mythology and have
        discovered contemporary significance and relevance in Classical
        mythological themes.
